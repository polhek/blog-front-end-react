# Front end for my Blog API

### Api Link:

    - [API Github Repository][1]

### Quick Summary:

This app was made with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It is basically a blog webpage, which I made for the sake of learning connecting my front-end to my back-end which I build with ExpressJS, which is framework for NodeJS. For database I used MongoDB, with MongooseJS. User or admin can login to a page with admins username and password, which issues him an expirable JWTtoken, which is then saved in local storage. Admin is able to post a new blog post, delete or publish/unpublish existing ones. He can also delete readers comments on blog posts.
